Book Express is a demo portal for purchasing books online.
It opens with a home page with demo of 6 books. 
There are + and - button for each book.Pressing the "+" button adds the book for which button is pressed to the cart. Pressing the "-" 
decrements the count. If count reaches 0 and user still tries to decrement, then a message " product count is already 0" is displayed.
Then heading on to the "order now" button, it transfers the control to new activity where details of customer is asked and then the same is 
transfered to mail for confirming order.
